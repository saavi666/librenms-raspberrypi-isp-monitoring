# Network Architecture

This section describes the final network architecture used for the LibreNMS deployment.

## Overview

* Raspberry Pi 5 acts as the Network Management System (NMS).
* Management traffic flows through a dedicated infrastructure VLAN.
* Huawei switches are monitored using SNMP v2c read-only access.
* Existing ISP monitoring systems remain unaffected.

Detailed diagrams and explanations will be added here.
